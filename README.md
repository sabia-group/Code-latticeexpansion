# lattice_expansion
Python script written by Vishikh Athavale (05/2017). It calculates the lattice expansion of any (noncubic) crystal at a given temperature. It necessitates at least 10 phonon calculations (corresponding to small displacements of the lattice parameters) as input. Please read readme.txt for additional information.
